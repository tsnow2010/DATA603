#### **Purpose**:

#### **Objectives**: 
> Use big data tools, including simulated streaming, to find “real-time,” accelerating keyword trends in email traffic.
> Answer the following questions:
> - Which keyword trends appeared before, during, and after the collapse of Enron?
> - Were the differences in trends significant between the three phases?
> - Could HR have predicted the calamity based on accelerating trend keywords in email traffic?
